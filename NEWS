Changes in 1.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fixed bug in poly.f90 test (work space too small, triggered
  for gfortran > 4.5 if -O0 used for build); thanks to Tobias 
  Burnus for pointing this out
* converted to autotools/autoconf based system. 


Changes in 0.9.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added new calls from GSL 1.15, except gsl_pow_uint
  (unsigned unsupported in C interop) and the gsl_vector_equal
  and gsl_matrix_equal calls.
* corrected PUBLICness for some fft calls. Thanks to 
  Dave Allured for reporting this.
* corrected bug in fgsl_odeiv_control_name
* removed unnecessary auxiliary interp functions
* documentation migrated from texi to doxygen-generated HTML.
* Note: I've received files for doing autoconf builds, but
  these have not been integrated yet.

Changes in 0.9.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added new calls from GSL 1.14
* corrected accessibility of some sorting routines
* added sort routines based on the fgsl_vector type.

Changes in 0.9.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed bug in multimin test. Thanks to Tobias Burnus for 
  pointing this out.
* fix for install target. Thanks to Kay Diederichs for
  pointing this out.
* added new calls from GSL 1.13, except for the VEGAS Monte
  Carlo accessors for which there already was something in
  place which does the job.

Changes in 0.9.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added examples for new APIs
* fixed bug in fft API mapping (assumed shape dummies are
  not interoperable) as well as a mistyped declaration
  (half-caught by NAG 5.2)
* introduced separate kind for complex handling
* constants changed for consistency with GSL 1.12
* added new features from GSL 1.11 and 1.12
* added --debug flag to configure

Changes in 0.9:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added examples for error handling
* added support for double precision complex vectors and matrices
* added linear algebra and eigensystem APIs
* added fourier transform API
* Note: testing of added APIs is not yet complete
* moved testing stuff to tests subdirectory

Changes in 0.8.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* bug fixes
* improved 32 vs. 64 bit handling (--bits switch for configure)
* OS X on Intel support

Fixes and new features in 0.8:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added string constants describing version and GSL base
* added new features from GSL 1.9 and 1.10 as far as deemed
  necessary for FGSL coverage.

Fixes and new features in first beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* augmented error treatment
* additional compilers added to configure script
* more fgsl_sizeof specifics
* extended (but not finished) manual
* testing much extended and many bugs/missing symbols fixed:
  - special functions
  - permutations and combinations
  - integration
  - permutations and combinations
  - sorting
  - random numbers (partially)
  - histograms (partially)

Fixes and new features in second alpha:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* statistics functions not exported, fixed
* changed permutation/combination data access to return
  a fortran pointer to enable referencing original data
* added further examples, nearly all from C are now mirrored
* added fgsl_sizeof generic, often needed for API calls with
  C polymorphic arguments
* the build process has been improved
